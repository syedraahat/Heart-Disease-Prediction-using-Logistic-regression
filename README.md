# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Logistic-regression
In this we will use logistic regression to predict whether the person has a heart disease or not using google colab
Algorithm
Import libraries like numpy and pandas and from sklearn import train_test_split, Logistic Regression, Accuracy Score
Upload the data file(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1grJSkMgZUyraHxrTb5ensedO0HTrSQN9/view?usp=drive_link) then read the csv file
Then split the features and target
Split the data into train and test data
Then we will train the model using logistic regression
Then we will check its accuracy
Then we will build the predictive system
